# Noodel

Noodel is a view component for presenting beautiful, dynamic content trees. Based on a unique swipe-based design that is simple and intuitive.

Noodel is incredibly versatile. You can use it as part of your webpage or use it to create and control a full site. As most types of content can be organized into trees, you can use it for blogs, documentation, knowledge maps and virtually anything else.

Currently available as a javascript library. Powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

# Noodel

Noodel is a UI framework for presenting beautiful, dynamic content trees. Based on an innovative swipe-based design that is simple and intuitive.

Noodel is incredibly versatile. You can use it as part of your webpage, or use it to build and control a full site. As most types of content can be organized into trees, you can use it for virtually anything - from static blogs and wikis, to dynamic sites with complex structure and flow.

Currently available as a javascript library. Powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Demo and documentation

So, how does it actually work? 

Well, as the ultimate proof of concept, Noodel uses itself to create and present its own docs ;)

[See here for the documentation](https://zlu883.github.io/Noodel/) (and hence live demo).

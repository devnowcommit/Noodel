            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <div class="noode">
                <p>Much of the content we encounter everyday can naturally be organized into tree structures.
                    Trees, however, are difficult to present on a viewing surface. As result, conventional
                    UI schemes tend to "flatten" trees into linear layouts - the most common offender being
                    lengthy vertical documents sliced into various sections and subsections, where
                    jumping between them can be a pain.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <p>This is sometimes helped by the presence of table of contents and navigation bars. But
                    such components occupy precious screen space (especially on mobile devices) and does not
                    scale well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <p>Noodel is a system design from the ground up for presenting content trees in a <i>different</i>
                    way - by directly integrating content with the navigation mechanism itself. It aims to be
                    much more intuitive and human-friendly by invoking the spatial memory of the viewer.</p>

            <h1>Concept</h1>
            <div class="noode">
                <h2>Noodes</h2>
                <p>Noodel breaks down content into individual containers called <i>noodes</i> (like
                the one you are looking at right now), which are equivalent to <i>nodes</i> in a content tree.
                Each noode contains its own block of content, and can have multiple ordered child noodes that
                contain blocks of sub-content. This
                can recurse infinitely to form a content tree of arbitrary size. A <i>noodel</i> refers
                to a whole content tree formed by noodes.</p>
                <div class="noode">
                    <p>Think of it like an infinite cascade of dropdown menus.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <h2>Trunk and branches</h2>
                <p>A set of sibling noodes listed in order is called a <i>branch</i>, and the axis on
                which they are ordered (vertical by default) is called the <i>branch axis</i>. The axis
                on which branches are ordered from parent branch to descendent branches (horizontal
                by default) is called the <i>trunk axis</i>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="noode">
                <h2>Navigation</h2>
                <p>The content tree can be navigated by moving in either of the 4 directions.
                Moving in the branch axis changes the <i>active</i> noode in that branch, which allows
                its descendent branches to be shown. Moving in the trunk axis changes the <i>focal</i>
                branch to a parent or child branch. At any given time, there is always a highlighted
                noode in focus, which is the active noode of the focal branch.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Noodel is a view component for presenting beautiful, dynamic content trees. Based on a
                unique swipe-based design that is simple and intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noodel is incredibly versatile. You can use it as part of your webpage or use it to
                create and control a full site. As most types of content can be organized into trees,
                you can use it for blogs, documentation, mindmaps and virtually anything else.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <div class="noode">
                    <p>
                        Much of the content we encounter everyday can naturally be organized into tree structures.
                        Trees, however, are difficult to present on a viewing surface. As result, conventional
                        UI schemes tend to "flatten" trees into linear layouts - the most common offender being
                        lengthy vertical documents sliced into various sections and subsections, where
                        jumping between them can be a pain.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="noode">
                    <p>
                        This is sometimes helped by the presence of table of contents and navigation bars. But
                        such components occupy precious screen space (especially on mobile devices) and does not
                        scale well.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        Noodel is a system design from the ground up for presenting content trees in a <i>different</i>
                        way - by directly integrating content with the navigation mechanism itself. It aims to be
                        much more intuitive and human-friendly by invoking the spatial memory of the viewer.

                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <div class="noode">
                    <h3>Noodes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Noodel breaks down content into individual containers called <i>noodes</i> (just like
                        the one you are looking at right now), which are equivalent to <i>nodes</i> in a content tree.
                        Each noode contains its own block of content, and can also have multiple ordered child noodes
                        each with their own block of sub-content. This
                        can recurse infinitely to form a content tree of arbitrary size. A <i>noodel</i> refers
                        to a whole content tree formed by noodes.
                    </p>
                    <div class="noode">
                        <p>Think of it like an infinite cascade of dropdown menus.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="noode">
                    <h3>Trunk and branches</h3>
                    <p>
                        A set of sibling noodes listed in order is called a <i>branch</i>, and the axis on
                        which they are ordered (vertical by default) is called the <i>branch axis</i>. The axis
                        on which branches are ordered from parent branch to descendent branches (horizontal
                        by default) is called the <i>trunk axis</i>.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="noode">
                    <h3>Navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The content tree can be navigated by moving in either of the 4 directions.
                        Moving in the branch axis changes the <i>active</i> noode in that branch, which allows
                        its descendent branches to be shown. Moving in the trunk axis changes the <i>focal</i>
                        branch to a parent or child branch. At any given time, there is always a highlighted
                        noode in focus, which is the active noode of the focal branch.
